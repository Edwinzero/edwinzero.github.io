My name is Shang Zhao. I am a Ph.D. student in [Institute of Computer Graphics](https://icg.gwu.edu/) at George Washington University. My research interests include cross reality (XR), 3D motion capture and analysis, physics simulation, and machine learning (ML). My research focuses on solving challenging problems in the medical domain. 

My primary research is ML with XR, which integrates the ML-based automated assessment with the visualization of XR. The aim of the research is to facilitate the training efficiency and effectiveness of medical education.  In addition, I also have done some research works in motion capture and surface reconstruction. I built a multimodal motion capture system with RGB-D cameras and VR devices, which can capture 3D motion and surfaces in real-time. In particular, correspondence finding and surface registration are my research topics in this domain.   

I received my B.S in Computer Science at Southwest University and M.S in Computer Science at George Washington University.

With great power, comes great responsibility.
