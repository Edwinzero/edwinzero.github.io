My name is Shang Zhao. I am a Ph.D. student in [Institute of Computer Graphics](https://icg.gwu.edu/) at George Washington University. My research interests include mixed reality, RGBD motion capture, real-time physics simulation, and machine learning. Most of my research focus on the medical domain. 

My current research is the mixed reality-based intelligent medical training system, which emerging the constructive feedback from automated intelligent assessments with the visualization of mixed reality for accelerating the medical skill acquisition for residents.
