My name is Shang Zhao. My research interests include extended reality (XR), machine learning (ML),3D motion reconstruction and analysis, and physics simulation. My research focuses on solving challenging problems in the medical domain. I got my Ph.D. degree from the [Institute of Computer Graphics](https://icg.gwu.edu/) at George Washington University. My academic advisor is [Dr. James Hahn](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/james-hahn).  

My primary research direction is ML with XR, which integrates the ML-based automated assessment with XR visualization for offering automated training experiences. I built an AR+AI training framework and a VR simulation framework for neonatal endotracheal intubation training. My research aim is to develop new medical training paradigms that facilitate medical training and clinical solutions. Besides, I also have done some research works in motion capture and surface reconstruction. I built a multi-modal motion capture system with RGB-D cameras and VR devices, capturing 3D motion and surfaces in real-time. In particular, correspondence finding and surface registration are my research topics in this domain.  

I received my B.S in Computer Science at Southwest University and M.S in Computer Science at George Washington University.

With great power, comes great responsibility.
