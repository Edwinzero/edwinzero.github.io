My name is Shang Zhao. I am a Ph.D. student in [Institute of Computer Graphics](https://icg.gwu.edu/) at George Washington University. My research interests include mixed reality, RGBD motion capture, real-time physics simulation, and machine learning. Most of my research focus on the medical domain. 

My current research is the mixed reality-based intelligent medical training system, which integrates neural network based intelligent assessments with the visualization of mixed reality for improving the medical skill acquisition for residents. Another research insterest for me is motion capture and surface reconstructon. I built a multimodal motion capture system with RGB-D cameras and VR devices, which can capture motion and surfaces in real-time. Correspondence finding and efficient shape registration is another sub-topic for me in this area.   

I received my B.S in Computer Science at Southwest Univeristy and M.S in Computer Science at George Washington University.

With great power, comes great responsibility.
